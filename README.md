# Identifying-precursors-of-amidated-neuropeptides-in-echinoderms---Supplementary-information
Supplementary information for the research project 'Identifying precursors of amidated neuropeptides in echinoderms'
'AmideSearch_Genus species' are excel files containing the information on proteins from an NCBI BLAST search with the motif xGyz up to 350 residues in length. x is any amino acid residue, y and z are arginine or lysine.
'Searches of interest_Genus speciesâ€™ are excel files containing uncharacterised proteins from 'AmideSearch_Strongylocentrotus pupuratus' that have a signal peptide probability over 0.5. 'The Already known NP' sheet contains a list of the known neuropeptides found in the amide search.
ChangedAmideSearch.ipynb is the code used to compile protein information. The files used for this are FASTA (completesequence) (txt), HIT Table (CSV) and Descriptions Table (CSV). See section 2 methods of the dissertation 'Identifying precursors of amidated neuropeptides in echinoderms' for more information.
